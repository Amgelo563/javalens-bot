A lightweight Discord bot for searching on Javadocs through slash commands.

---

## üöß Warnings (READ THIS!)

- The bot works by scraping each Javadoc, and saving **every** message in a local `__cache__` folder. This is done to avoid querying them in runtime, so (apart from the Discord connection), the bot works entirely offline.
- Depending on the javadoc's size, **this can get storage-heavy and take a while (100+ MBs and 5-10 mins for a large javadoc).** However, it shouldn't need more than 5-10 MBs of RAM while running.
- There are options to make the process faster, though not lighter. For more information, check the `advanced` field in the config documentation.
- This uses the [`javadocs-scraper`](http://github.com/Amgelo563/javadocs-scraper) library for the scraping process. For issues with the scraping, please open an issue there instead.

## üß© Features

### üß± Custom commands
- Define your command's entire data, down to the [Installation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/application#installation-context) and [Interaction](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#interaction-contexts) contexts.
- Group javadocs in a single command with subcommands, eg `/my-project v1 <query>` and `/my-project v2 <query>`.
- [Localize](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/Locale#Index) commands and their options for Discord clients on a specific language.

### üîç Advanced querying
- Query for classes, methods, fields, enums, enum constants, annotations and annotation elements with a single option.
- Filter results based on key characters, eg. `@` for annotations and `#`/`.` for methods or fields.

### üìö Useful results
- Get a insightful yet concise summary of the result, including short descriptions, parameters, return types and relevant links to the full documentation.
- Documents and highlights deprecation and/or for removal elements.

## üíª Usage
### 1. ‚öô Configuration

Create a `config.conf` file. The `example-config.conf` has a minimal example, the following is more complete with all the options available.

> [!TIP]
> If an option is listed as optional, you can not only omit it, but also partially define it.
> For example, if you want to change the `description` max length, you can only define that option and the rest will fallback to the defaults shown here.

## 2. üì¶ Installing and Running

Run `pnpm install` to install the required dependencies, then `pnpm clean-start` to build and run the bot.
- After building, you can run `pnpm start` to run the bot without rebuilding it.
- If you ever want to update, `git pull` the latest changes and run `pnpm clean-start` again.
